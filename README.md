# Python-Scripts
This is a collection of little Python scripts I have created as fun projects. One is a plotter that simulates data input from two different sources and displays them on the same graph, and the other is an image scraper that can download XKCD comics to a folder

This plotter automatically adjusts its axes as it nears their limit. It looks a little weird because both graphs start on the lefthand side even though the axes for the red graph are at the top and bottom. Since the blue graph is faster than the red one, it looks like both plots are changing but you will notice the red axes stay the same until their limit is almost reached. This could be made easier to interpret by separating each graph to have its own y axis but perhaps making them share an X axis
